# xlang Programming Development

## Overview

_`xlang`_ is a programming language under development, designing everything from scratch `just for fun` to where I can stop the development. This roadmap outlines the milestones and releases for lexical analysis (v0.1.x), syntax and semantic analysis (v0.2.x), intermediate code generation and code optimization (v0.3.x), and target code generation (v0.4.x), implemented in PHP with a custom testing framework. Each milestone builds on the previous, ensuring a stable foundation for future features.

## Under-Compiler versions

This under-compiler versions cover the under development versioning from lexical analyzer (tokenizing) to initial syntax analyzer (parsing) processes of the compiler.

- [x] v0.1.0: Lexeme sequence: Comment & Integer Tokenization
- [x] v0.1.1: Scalar types, Special type, & Identifier Tokenization
- [ ] v0.1.x: Enclosed Symbols & String Tokenization
- [ ] v0.1.x: Unary Operators, & Binary Operators Tokenization
- [ ] v0.1.x: Label and Entry Label Tokenization
- [ ] v0.1.x: Function & Lambda Tokenization
- [ ] v0.2.x: Initial Tree Intermediate Representation (IR) Parsing
